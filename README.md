**Claude Prompt Optimizer** is a meta-prompting system that transforms vague, unstructured prompts into professionally optimized prompts following [Anthropic's official best practices](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering). Paste any raw prompt — from a one-liner to a detailed brief — and get back a structured, XML-tagged, model-specific prompt engineered for Claude Opus 4.6's full capabilities.

> **This is not a prompt collection.** It's a systematic optimization engine with 10 codified rules, a 10-component prompt architecture, and complexity-based routing — all derived from Anthropic's documentation and real-world testing.

The optimizer analyzed the vague input, inferred the likely use case, added a domain-expert role, defined constraints for production quality, and structured everything with XML tags that Claude Opus 4.6 parses with precision.

## ✨ Features

- **10 Codified Optimization Rules** — systematic, reproducible prompt improvements based on Anthropic's documentation
- **10-Component Prompt Framework** — modular architecture covering role, context, task, constraints, examples, and more
- **Complexity-Based Routing** — automatically scales optimization depth (minimal → moderate → full) based on prompt complexity
- **Claude Opus 4.6 Specific** — tuned for 200K context window, adaptive thinking, literal instruction following, and no-prefill architecture
- **XML Tag Structuring** — transforms flat text into semantically tagged sections that Claude parses reliably
- **Ambiguity Resolution** — detects missing information and either infers it or prompts you for clarification
- **Domain Detection** — identifies the prompt's domain (coding, creative writing, analysis, etc.) and applies domain-specific patterns
- **Quality Guardrails** — built-in checks prevent common failure modes like over-optimization, hallucination triggers, and context overflow
- **Language Preservation** — responds in the user's language; optimized prompts stay in the original language unless you request otherwise
- **Iterative Refinement** — give feedback and the optimizer revises targeted sections without re-doing the full analysis

```

**The 5-step workflow under the hood:**

1. **Prompt Analysis** — the optimizer detects intent, complexity level, domain, expected output type, and missing elements
2. **Complexity Routing** — simple prompts get 3–4 components; moderate ones get 5–7; complex prompts get the full 10-component framework
3. **Rule Application** — the relevant subset of 10 optimization rules fires (not all rules apply to every prompt)
4. **Quality Check** — a built-in checklist ensures the task is unambiguous, XML tags are valid, examples match the desired behavior, and no contradictory instructions exist
5. **Structured Output** — you receive the analysis, the optimized prompt in a copy-ready code block, and concise notes explaining what changed and why

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

Choose the method that fits your workflow:

### Option A: Claude Project (Recommended)

1. Open [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) and create a new **Project**
2. Paste the contents of [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) into the **Project Instructions** field
3. Upload [`GUIDE.md`](GUIDE.md) as a **knowledge file** in the project
4. Start a conversation — paste any raw prompt and the optimizer handles the rest

### Option B: Direct Paste

1. Copy the full contents of [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md)
2. Paste it as the **system prompt** in any Claude interface (API Console, Workbench, etc.)
3. Send your raw prompt as the user message

### Option C: API Integration

```python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

# Load the optimizer system prompt
with open("CLAUDE.md", "r") as f:
    system_prompt = f.read()

message = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-4-6-20250929",
    max_tokens=8096,
    system=system_prompt,
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Your raw prompt here"}
    ]
)

print(message.content[0].text)
```

### Meta Commands

Once running, you can type these commands in the conversation:

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `help` | Explains how the optimizer works |
| `rules` | Shows a compact summary of all 10 optimization rules |
| `example` | Displays a full before/after optimization demo |
| `framework` | Shows the 10-component framework overview |
| `tips` | Gives 5 practical tips for writing better input prompts |

---

## 📏 The 10 Optimization Rules

| # | Rule | What It Does |
|---|------|-------------|
| 1 | **Be Explicit & Detailed** | Replaces vague instructions with specific, detailed ones. Claude 4.x follows instructions literally — precision pays off. |
| 2 | **Provide Context & Motivation** | Explains *why* an instruction matters, not just *what* to do. Claude performs better when it understands the purpose. |
| 3 | **Use XML Tags for Structure** | Wraps prompt sections in semantic XML tags (`<role>`, `<task>`, `<constraints>`, etc.) that Claude is trained to parse reliably. |
| 4 | **Inject Few-Shot Examples** | Adds 3–5 diverse input/output examples when the task involves classification, formatting, or ambiguous patterns. |
| 5 | **Activate Chain-of-Thought** | Adds explicit step-by-step reasoning triggers for complex tasks. Works with Opus 4.6's adaptive thinking to boost quality. |
| 6 | **Assign an Expert Role** | Gives Claude a specific persona with domain expertise, experience level, and communication style. |
| 7 | **Define Output Format Explicitly** | Prescribes the exact structure, length, and format of the response. Uses positive phrasing ("write prose paragraphs" not "don't use lists"). |
| 8 | **Optimize for Long Context** | Places long documents at the start of the prompt, tags them with indexed XML, and instructs Claude to extract before answering. |
| 9 | **Steer Tool Use & Agentic Behavior** | Clearly specifies whether Claude should *act* or *advise*, and encourages parallel tool calls for independent actions. |
| 10 | **Prevent Over-Engineering** | Adds explicit anti-overengineering clauses to keep Claude focused on what was actually requested. |

> **Not every rule fires for every prompt.** A simple factual question won't get 10 XML tags — it'll get a clean, focused refinement. The optimizer scales proportionally.

## 🏗️ Prompt Framework (10 Components)

The optimizer draws from 10 structural components when building the optimized prompt. Think of these as building blocks — the optimizer selects the right subset based on complexity routing.

## 🎯 Why Claude Opus 4.6 Specific?

This optimizer isn't model-agnostic. It's specifically tuned for Claude Opus 4.6's architecture and behaviors:

| Feature | How the Optimizer Uses It |
|---------|--------------------------|
| **200K Context Window** | Generates comprehensive prompts with full examples and context without worrying about token limits. Uses long-context optimization (Rule 8) to place documents correctly. |
| **Adaptive Thinking** | Strategically triggers extended thinking for complex reasoning tasks. Avoids the word "think" when extended thinking may be disabled (uses "analyze", "evaluate" instead). |
| **XML Tag Parsing** | Claude Opus 4.6 parses XML tags as semantic structure — the optimizer exploits this with consistent, well-nested tags. |
| **Literal Instruction Following** | Claude 4.x follows instructions more literally than predecessors. Examples are adopted exactly. The optimizer writes precise, unambiguous instructions. |
| **No Prefill Support** | Opus 4.6 returns a 400 error on assistant prefills. The optimizer never generates prefill patterns — it uses explicit format instructions instead. |
| **Over-Engineering Tendency** | Opus models tend to add unrequested features. Rule 10 adds explicit anti-overengineering clauses when appropriate. |
| **Positive Phrasing** | Claude 4.x responds better to "do X" than "don't do Y". The optimizer formulates all instructions positively. |
| **Action vs. Advice Distinction** | Claude 4.x distinguishes sharply between "suggest changes" and "implement changes". The optimizer makes this explicit. |
